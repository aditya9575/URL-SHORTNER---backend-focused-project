Note for the project to run the backend connection must be established so inorder for you to run replace the connection driver url for mongoDB

1)to create the url's shortenend version -> send a post request on -> http://localhost:8001/url  
 ,-> with body as json and inside the json the url that you want to shorten 
 (if you get a successful response copy the id that you get in the response) 


2)now to check if the shortenend url is working we simply send a get request on the same route just by replacing the url in it with the 
id we got from the post request ->http://localhost:8001/Z6afLHfLV
(if in the response the desired site opens up we are good to go )


3)Now to get analytics copy the unique id and hit a get request on -> http://localhost:8001/url/analytics/ paste your copied id here
example-> http://localhost:8001/url/analytics/FNErs1O5S
(and this will give us the analytics and its details all including how many clicks on the link and etc )
